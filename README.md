Description
--------------
A little gamejam project of students from the HAW Hamburg. It is a 3d Multiplayer game in which the players have to find one another in a world full of bots. The topic for the game was "Is there another player". Feel free to use our source code and graphics :) (Even though we would be happy if you gave credits to us it is not necessary).

Controls:
--------------
You can move the cube with W,A,S,D. Jumping is trigged with the spacebar. The game is over once you hit another cube. If it's a human both win the game, if its a bot, you lose the game.
